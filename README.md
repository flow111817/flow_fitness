# Fitness_optimization
###Project Introduction
Lightweight push up motion recognition based on movenet, supporting real-time counting, keyframe capture, motion visualization analysis, suitable as an auxiliary tool for fitness
###Project Features
-  ✅  Real time action recognition and counting
-  🎥  Save keyframe animation as MP4
-  📊  Visualization of counting results (with real time on the horizontal axis)
###Installation
```bash
git clone  https://github.com/yourusername/AwesomePushupCounter.git
cd AwesomePushupCounter
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
###Instructions for use
In main. py, you can set whether to use a camera or a recorded video for recognition. In config. py, you can set parameters such as moving object, output directory, and analysis parameters
